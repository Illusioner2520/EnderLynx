# EnderLynx

EnderLynx is a Minecraft launcher that is currently a work in progress. All versions are in alpha currently, therefore expect plenty of bugs and missing features. If you encounter a bug when using the app, please report it in the issues tab.

## Requirements

Currently, EnderLynx only supports Windows 64-bit. Unfortunately, you will not be able to run the program if this is not your system.
For space required on the disk, the app itself requires 437 MB, however any installed instances (especially large modpacks) can significantly increase the amount of space required.

## Technologies

EnderLynx is built using [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) and packaged by [Electron Forge](https://www.electronforge.io/). It uses [NSIS](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Main_Page) for its installer.
