# EnderLynx

EnderLynx is a Minecraft launcher that is currently a work in progress. We are currently in beta, therefore expect plenty of bugs. If you encounter a bug when using the app, please report it in the issues tab. If you want something added to the app, please request it in the issues tab.

## Requirements

Currently, EnderLynx only supports Windows 64-bit. Unfortunately, you will not be able to run the program if this is not your system. As for space required on the disk, the app itself requires less than 512 MB, however any installed instances (especially large modpacks) can significantly increase the amount of space required.
